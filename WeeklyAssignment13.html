<h2>DOGE vs. DOW</h2>
<p>For this project I chose to analyze the performance of Dogecoin versus the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from 2014 to the present. The DIJA is a stock index that monitors and represents the performance of 30 of the largest publicly traded companies on the New York Stock Exchange. I believe that from our data we can infer that the price of DOGE coin will rise as does the performance of the DJIA index.</p>
<p>I have chosen to start my analysis from the first point DOGE was traded up until currently as there is present DJIA data for that period and I wanted to see the relationship over its entire life so far. I was able to source the DJIA data from the website for the Feral Bank of Saint Louis. It is important to note that the DOW was created in 1896 but has changed drastically since then including expanding from an original group of 8 companies.</p>
<p>The graph below shows us the closing price for Dogecoin for the time period we are investigating. We see a minor ridge around the beginning of 2018 where it had hit a high-of-the-time of $0.019. From there we donâ€™t see any other significant changes till the beginning of 2021 where we start to the meteoric rise of the cryptocurrency. The most significant rise has occurred in the most recent months with it seeing a $0.20 increase in April of 2021 alone.</p>

<p>The graph below shows of the closing price for the DJIA over the same time period. Overall we can see a steady rate of growth for the index over time with some major and small events in between. We see some significant increase around the beginning of 2018 and May of 2020 as well. The rise in May of 2020 was followed a massive decline in the DJIA starting around November of 2019. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While there are some events that may raise questions of correlation between the prive of Dogecoin and the DJIA, I believe that the price of DOGE is not related to the performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We can assume that the similarities in performance around 2018 were caused by mass popularity for Dogecoin and false sense of economic strength during the beginning Trump administration. </p>
